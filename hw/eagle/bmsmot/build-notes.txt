1. Voltage divider
R15 - 110K
R14 - 28.7K

2. 0.1 instead of 50n
C103,C104,C105

2. H11L1 - Need pullups

- The output is open drain and needs a
pullup. The processor internal pullup
is weak.

- 5.6K tacked to pins was used.

3. AC-DET H11L1 gnd & output error

- Hack needed to reverse GND and output.

4. 'V1 pcb layout was updated for pullups
and AC-DET wiring.

5. Hack for keyswitch 

R104 and D100 serve to turn on PFET 12v
power switch.

- Remove R104 & D100.
- Add NFET with +/- Vgs across D100 pads
(gnd and gate). 
- Cut trace going to PA12 
- Jumper wire from PA12 side of cut to
NFET drain.
- Update eagle bmsmot-v1

6. Coin-cell polarity protection

Added 18K resistor in + trace to prevent
reversed coin-cell insertion from damaging
processor via VBAT.
