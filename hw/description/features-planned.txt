Relay driver FETs
  Timer driven (pwm)
   Flyback diodes
   4 pin keyed Molex
   1a load or less
- Contactor precharge relay
- Cooling pump motor relay
- Air compressor motor relay (probably one per winch)
- AC/DC switch relay (probably one per winch)

HV FETs (>80v Vds)
  Timer driven (pwm)
   Flyback diodes (optional)
   4 pin keyed
   1a load or less
- Contactor #1 coil
- Contactor #2 coil

High current FETs
  Timer driven (pwm)
  Flyback diodes
  10a or less
  Spade lugs or PowerPole stub
- DMOC FANs (4a) 
- Heat exchanger FAN (6a)

I/O pin (not FET) driven LEDs
- LED Grn: program status
- LED Red: program status
- LED Red: BMS12v pwr on (?)

Power status LEDs
- PFET 12v BMS power
- Polarity protected 12v power

I/O inputs
- Contactor #1 aux contact
- Contactor #2 aux contact
- WHAT ELSE?

USART
  DMA channel available
- Monitor/debugging (TX/RX)
- Rx isolated HV measurements
- EMC/hub communication

CAN
- CAN1: BMS bus
- CAN2: JIC, not 12v pwr switched

ADC inputs
- 12v after polarity PFET (onboard)
(The following might better be done on the isolated contactor HV processor 
  since the bmsmot main circuits are high current and some are pwm'ing.)
- Hall-effect sensor (3 pin Molex keyed)

(The resolution for the following is not high so they can be on the system
 side pcb)
- Coolant inlet temp thermistor (2 pin hdr)
- Coolant outlet temp thermistor (2 pin hdr)
- Ambient (coolant/heat exchanger) air temp (2 pin hdr)

Isolated HV measurement
- 'L431 processor
- opto-isolator, uart tx via FET drive 
- four HV adc divider inputs (0.1" header)
- 5v dc-dc 
- Hall effect sensor input (3 pin keyed)
(dc-dc may need to be greater than 5v so that a linear regulator
 feeds the 5v for the Hall effect sensor)


Misc--
- 12 power polarity protection PFET (BMS + DMOC fans + FETs = ~12a)
- Pushbutton reset processor
- Pushbutton Master Reset (?)
- jumper to by-pass 12v BMS power PFET, or have BMS 12v constant on
- opto-isolated Master reset
- CR2032 coin cell (VBAT)
